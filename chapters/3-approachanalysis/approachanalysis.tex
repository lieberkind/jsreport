\chapter{Approach Analysis}
	The problem definition stated that we would investigate:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item How to move JavaScript errors from client to server side
		\item How to generate JavaScript from server side code in order to gain server-client portability
		\item How to achieve compile time guarantee of the consistentcy between the generated JavaScript and HTML elements (JavaScript-HTML consistency)
	\end{itemize}

	This chapter will give an overview of different technologies we have considered to use to address the first two improvements from the above list, and describe how these technologies can be used in combination to approach the project in different ways.

	JavaScript-HTML consistency is dependent on the fact that ASP.NET Web Forms provide a compile time validated representation of HTML elements in the form of Web Controls (see \ref{sub:code_behind}). Therefore, JavaScript-HTML consistency is accommodated equally by all the approaches considered below. The fact that Web Controls exists in this compile time validated environment (Code Behind) together with a representation of JavaScript is what makes it possible to guarantee JavaScript-HTML consistency. How JavaScript is represented in this environment is not really important when looking at JavaScript-HTML consistency isolated. Because of this, the different approaches have not been rated on this criterion.

	Now, it has already been mentioned that MiCS makes use of Microsoft's Roslyn in combination with Script\# to approach this project. This chapter describes \emph{how} we arrived at this approach. Therefore, the most important parts of this chapter is:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Section \ref{sub:microsoft_roslyn}, which explains Microsoft's Roslyn in detail
		\item Section \ref{sub:subsection_scriptsharp}, which explains Script\# in details
		\item Section \ref{sub:mics_mixed_side_csharp}, which explains how MiCS uses Roslyn and Script\# in combination
	\end{itemize}

	All other of the following considerations have been important to our process. However, they are not important in order to understand how MiCS works.

\section{Useful Technologies}
	\label{sec:useful_technologies}
	This section introduces the different technologies considered useful to this project. Script\# and Microsoft Roslyn will be described in detail, as they were eventually chosen for the implementation of MiCS.

	\subsection{Script\#} % (fold)
	\label{sub:subsection_scriptsharp}
		Script\# (pronounced ``scriptsharp'') \cite{scriptsharp} is a cross-compiler from C\# to JavaScript that is maintained by Nikhil Kothari \cite{nikhilk} from Microsoft. Script\# works by compiling an entire C\# project to JavaScript. Script\# is interesting for several reasons; it contains an AST-representation of JavaScript in C\# and a way to generate JavaScript source code from this AST. Furthermore, it contains a C\# representation of the DOM (Document Object Model).

		The main assembly, ScriptSharp.dll, is shown in figure \ref{simplifiedOverview} as a simplified dependency diagram. When Script\# is used in a regular manner, an AST representing C\# source code is built using classes from the Parser and CodeModel namespaces. The ScriptModel namespace contains classes which represent the different nodes in the JavaScript AST. The actual JavaScript source code is generated using classes from the Generator namespace. Another important assembly is the Script.Web.dll which contains classes for DOM representation. A DOM representation is needed for our case study to work.

			\caption{Simplified Script\# architecture overview (dependency diagram).}
			\label{simplifiedOverview}
		\end{figure}


		A thing unique to Script\# is that it defines a modified version of the .NET mscorlib.dll (also shown in figure \ref{simplifiedOverview}) that modifies the .NET core type interfaces to resembles their equivalent JavaScript objects. E.g. the Script\#-defined System.String type has a \texttt{CharAt(int index)} function (figure \ref{fig:scriptsharp_net_types}) that doesn't exist on the original .NET \texttt{System.String}. However, it \emph{does} exist on the JavaScript \texttt{String} object. One benefit of the modified mscorlib.dll is that it makes the C\# compiler able to validate the C\# code that represents JavaScript. However, \emph{evaluating} C\# code that uses these modified .NET types will never make sense, as all of the methods and fields on them either returns null, 0, or false, as shown in figure \ref{fig:scriptsharp_net_types}. This implies that the Script\# modified core types can only be used for JavaScript generation, and can not be run on server side.

			\begin{lstlisting}[language=CSharp,classoffset=1,morekeywords={String}]
namespace System {

  /// <summary>
  /// Equivalent to the String type in Javascript.
  /// </summary>
  [ScriptIgnoreNamespace]
  [ScriptImport]
  public sealed class String {

    ...

    /// <summary>
    /// The number of characters in the string.
    /// </summary>
    [ScriptField]
    public int Length {
      get {
        return 0;
      }
    }

    ...

    /// <summary>
    /// Retrieves the character at the specified position.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="index">The specified 0-based position.</param>
    /// <returns>The character within the string.</returns>
    public char CharAt(int index) {
      return '\0';
    }

    ...
  }
}

			\end{lstlisting}
			\caption{Properties and methods on Script\#'s String type}
			\label{fig:scriptsharp_net_types}
		\end{figure}

		In short the modified mscorlib.dll file is referenced in one's Visual Studio project (instead of the original one) when a new Script\# project is created. When a Script\# project is compiled a JavaScript file will be generated. This JavaScript file can then be used in other projects (E.g. a Web Forms web application). The C\# source code will not be evaluated.

	% % subsection microsoft_roslyn (end)

	\subsection{Code Quotations} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:code_quotations}
		Code Quotations is a built-in feature in the F\# language which lets a developer generate an abstract syntax tree that represents the corresponding F\# code. Code Quotations cover the entire F\# language.

	% subsection code_quotations (end)

	\subsection{Expression Trees} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:expression_trees}
			Expression Trees is a built-in feature in the C\# (and Visual Basic) language that ``represents code in a tree-like data structure, where each node is an expression, for example, a method call or a binary operation'' \cite{expression_trees}. Expression Trees are often used with LINQ to build dynamic queries, which can be useful when fetching data from a database with filters specified by the user. Expression Trees can be generated from lambda expressions, and thus it is possible to retrieve a representation of simple pieces of code. Additionally, Expression Trees can be dynamically compiled and executed.
	% subsection expression_trees (end)

	\subsection{Internal DSL} % (fold)
	\label{ssub:internal_dsl}
		There are different approaches to writing a Domain Specific Languages (DSL). Internal DSLs are written in a regular language (e.g. C\#) and is therefore also constrained by this language and its features \cite{domain_specific_languages}. This is in contrast to an external DSL, which defines its own syntax. Another term for internal DSL is fluent interface, whose central pattern is that of method chaining which is the pattern we somewhat investigated for the use of safe JavaScript representation. In our case we aimed for an internal DSL that somewhat resembled the C-like syntax of JavaScript.

\section{Stages When Going From .NET Language to JavaScript} % (fold)
\label{sec:stages_when_going_from_net_language_to_javascript}
	The previous section described useful technologies, and the next section will describe how these technologies can be used in combination to address server-client portability and moving JavaScript errors from client to server side. However, before discussing different approaches it makes sense to clarify the possible stages in the process of going from a C\# or F\# to JavaScript. The process (displayed in figure \ref{stages}) moves from left to right. Different approaches use different stages.

		\begin{figure}[H]

				\centerline{\includegraphics[width=14cm]{resources/images/stages.png}}
			\end{center}
			\caption{Possible approach stages}
			\label{stages}
		\end{figure}

	 From concrete syntax a C\# or F\# abstract syntax tree (AST) can be generated. This AST can be traversed in order to map it to a JavaScript AST. Finally, JavaScript can be generated from the JavaScript AST.

\section{Deciding on Approach} % (fold)
\label{sec:deciding_on_approach}
	In the previos sections we have described various technologies, how they can be used in combination to form approaches, and some of the benefits and disadvantages of these approaches. To make a final decission on which approach to choose for implementation, an approach matrix has been made. The matrix evaluates the different approaches based on 9 different critera. The approach matrix is shown in figure \ref{approachMatrix}, and below each criterion is explained. All approaches accommodate JavaScript-HTML consistency which is why no ratings are given on this matter.

	\begin{figure}
		\begin{center}
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=16cm]{resources/images/approachmatrix.eps}}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Approach Matrix.}
		\label{approachMatrix}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Server Client Portability} The ability to generate JavaScript from working server side code
		\item \textbf{Ease of Use} How easy the approach is to use for the developer
		\item \textbf{Compile Time Errors} Amount of errors this approach will catch on compile time
		\item \textbf{AST Benefits} How easily the developer's code can be converted to an AST
		\item \textbf{Consise Syntax} How concise the syntax of the approach will be
		\item \textbf{Existing Infrastructure} The degree to which the approach makes use of existing C\# or F\# infrastructure
		\item \textbf{Experience with .NET Language} How well we know the language in which the approach is implemented
		\item \textbf{Ease of Unit Testing} How easily the developer can unit test the code from which JavaScript is generated
	\end{itemize}

	We have rated approach criteria from 0 to 3 where three is the best. With the approach matrix as support we decided to implement the C\# to Roslyn to Script\# to JavaScript approach. The approach was named Mixed Side C Sharp (MiCS).

	\FloatBarrier

	\subsection{Chosen solution: MiCS - Mixed Side C\#} % (fold)
	\label{sub:mics_mixed_side_csharp}
	The chosen solution is the one described in section \ref{ssub:c_to_roslyn_to_script_to_javascript}: C\# to Roslyn to Script\# to JavaScript. The solution is called MiCS, short for Mixed Side C\#, because it will allow the developer to write C\# server side code, which can be translated to JavaScript and used on client side as well. This eliminates the need for writing actual JavaScript code, and instead have it generated from a safer, compile-time validated language.

	MiCS will use Roslyn and Script\# in combination. Roslyn will be used to generate an AST representing the developer's C\# source code. The core functionality of MiCS will be to map this generated AST to a Script\# JavaScript AST. Script\#'s JavaScript generator will be used to generate the actual JavaScript source code. In the following chapters the design and implementation of this approach will be described in detail.
