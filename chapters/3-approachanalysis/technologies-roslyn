	% Roslyn is a Microsoft project that exposes the C# and Visual Basic compilers as services. Even though the two are alike, we will focus on C#. Roslyn is able to generate an AST from C# source code, and as with Code Quotations, Roslyn is full fidelity (REF) which means that all C# constructs can be recognized and parsed into syntax nodes. In fact, the AST generated by Roslyn contains every single character of the original source code, down to the last piece of whitespace. Thus, Roslyn combines the advantages of Code Quotations and Expression Trees by allowing the generation of an AST from every C# construct (including blocks), and avoiding the unfamiliar F# syntax.


	% Key features of Roslyn
	% 	Able to generate full-fidelity SyntaxTree
	% 	SyntaxWalker - visitor pattern allows depth-first travesal of SyntaxTree
	% 	Semantic Model -
