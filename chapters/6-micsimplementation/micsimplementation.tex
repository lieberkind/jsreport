\chapter{MiCS Implementation}
	In this chapter, the implementation of MiCS will be described. It will explain each of the five stages when generating JavaScript from C\# as explained in section \ref{sec:workflow_overview}. For clarity purposes, the third stage (Building + Mapping to Script\# AST) is divided into two different sections.

\section{Mapping to Script\# AST} % (fold)
\label{sec:mapping_to_scriptsharp_ast}
	When converting the validated Roslyn AST to its corresponding Script\# AST, a logical division of the process has been made. 

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mapping a Roslyn AST node to its equivalent Script\# AST node
		\item Building a Script\# AST from all the mapped nodes
	\end{itemize}

	It is important to realize that the mapping is a sub process of the building process. The mapping is discussed in this section. 

	\subsection{Expressions, Statements and Symbols} % (fold)
	\label{sub:subsection_mapping_to_scriptsharp_expressions_statements_and_symbols}
		The mapping of Expressions, Statements and Symbols is implemented in three classes (ExpressionMapper.cs, StatementMapper.cs and SymbolMapper.cs). The three classes are logically divided (and named) after the kind of Script\# AST node they map to.

			\end{center}
			\caption{Classes that define extension methods for mapping Roslyn AST nodes to Script\# AST nodes.}
			\label{mapperClasses}
		\end{figure}

		Mapping of AST nodes is somewhat straightforward as most Roslyn AST nodes have an equivalent Script\# AST node. E.g. a Roslyn return statement node maps to a Script\# return statement etc. The three mapper classes define \texttt{Map(...)} extension methods to the Roslyn node objects they map from (see example figures \ref{returnStatementMap} and \ref{conditionaleExpressionMap}).

	\subsection{Type Mapping} % (fold)
	\label{sub:type_mapping}
		Roslyn type symbols are mapped to Script\# type symbols using the \texttt{SymbolMapper}’s \texttt{Map(...)} extension method created for the Roslyn \texttt{TypeSymbol}. The mapping of type symbols from Roslyn to Script\# can be somewhat confusing since there are the different kinds of types (illustrated in figure \ref{typesOverview}) and there are some special cases (such as \texttt{null} which is mapped to the type \texttt{Object} in JavaScript). To illustrate the functionality of the \texttt{TypeSymbol} \texttt{Map(...)} method we have created the flowchart in figure \ref{typeMappingFlowchart}.

			\begin{figure}
			\begin{center}
					\includegraphics[width=14cm]{resources/images/TypeMappingFlowchart.png}
					\end{center}
				\caption{The type mapping process performed in \texttt{SymbolMapper.Map(this TypeSymbol typeSymbol)} extension method.}
				\label{typeMappingFlowchart}
			\end{figure}


		\subsubsection{Core Type Mapping} % (fold)
		\label{subsub:core:type_mapping}
			In contrast to using Script\# in the original manner (where the Script\# core types are used when writing code instead of the .NET core types) our project only uses the Script\# core types when mapping to the Script\# JavaScript AST. For this reason the Script\# core types are handled by its own type manager class (\texttt{ScriptSharpTypeManager.cs}). From the \texttt{ScriptSharpTypeManager} the Roslyn type symbols are retrieved before they are mapped to Script\# type symbols needed when building the Script\# AST.

			Since the .NET core types are used when writing code with MiCS and since these are mapped to the Script\# core types a mapping specification is needed. To facilitate this mapping we have created some simple classes to hold the specification (\texttt{MiCSCoreMapping.cs}, \texttt{MiCSCoreTypeMapping.cs} and \texttt{MiCSCoreMemberMapping.cs}) which can be queried using LINQ. This mapping specification contains information on the core types that we currently support. If a core type is not described in the specification then it is not supported. If the core type is found in the specification then the same pattern applies for its members. If a type member is not found then it is not supported. The mapping specification also holds information on a member’s return type, number of arguments and the arguments’ types.

			\begin{figure}[H]
					\includegraphics[width=8cm]{resources/images/InitiationOfTypeMapping.png}
				\caption{Instantiation example of a single core type (System.String) mapping specification.}
				\label{coreTypeMapping}
			\end{figure}

			An example of a core type mapping is the C\# System.String (see figure \ref{coreTypeMapping}) type which is mapped to the Script\# defined \texttt{System.String}. We are only mapping two of the String type’s members. The field \texttt{Length} which is mapped to the Script\# \texttt{String} type’s \texttt{Length} field (which is the equivalent of the JavaScript \texttt{String} object's property \texttt{length}). The second member we map is the \texttt{IndexOf(Char char)} method that returns an int. There are other \texttt{IndexOf} methods that take multiple arguments or a single argument of a different type (than \texttt{Char}) but these are not mapped in our mapping specification.

			Apart from the regular core types (i.e. the core types defined in the .NET \texttt{mscorlib.dll}) Script\# defines additional types in its \texttt{mscorlib.dll} file. One example is the regular expression class \texttt{Regex} which is of special interest as it is used in our case study. Usually the \texttt{Regex} class is placed in the \texttt{System.Text.RegularExpressions} namespace. In the Script\# \texttt{mscorlib.dll} however \texttt{Regex} is placed in the \texttt{System} namespace. The core type mapping should also express such differences in namespaces.

\section{Building the Script\# AST} % (fold)
\label{sec:building_the_scriptsharp_ast}
	Building the Script\# AST consists of taking the mapped AST nodes and putting them together to form the Script\# AST. The builder classes uses the Roslyn infrastructure by extending the \texttt{SyntaxWalker} class which makes them capable of traversing the Roslyn AST.
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=16cm]{resources/images/BuilderClasses.png}}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Classes that build the Script\# AST by traversing the Roslyn AST and using the \texttt{Map(...)} extension methods.}
		\label{builderClasses}
	\end{figure}

	The \texttt{NamespaceBuilder} class is responsible for building all of the types contained in a namespace. This is done by instantiating a \texttt{ClassBuilder} which in turn is responsible for building all of the member methods in a class (which is done using a \texttt{MethodBuilder}). This implies that the building of the Script\# AST is done in a depth first manner (the same way the Roslyn AST is traversed).  

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=16cm]{resources/images/VisitClassDeclaration.png}}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Empty Script\# class is created and then built by using a \texttt{MethodBuilder} to retrieve all its member methods. The \texttt{ssClasses} property on the class builder holds all the classes that will be returned to the \texttt{NamespaceBuilder} who created it.}
		\label{visitClassDeclaration}
	\end{figure}

	The \texttt{NamespaceBuilder} and \texttt{ClassBuilder} classes are somewhat trivial. The \texttt{ClassBuilder} however ensures that DOM or core types are not be mapped to Script\#. The DOM and core types doesn't need to be generated as JavaScript types because they are built in types that already exists in JavaScript.

	The \texttt{MethodBuilder} class is a little more complex. It needs to build only the methods that are mixed side or client side methods. Furthermore it needs to handle a method’s return type, arguments and body statements. 

	Likewise the \texttt{StatementBuilder} and \texttt{ExpressionBuilder} are somewhat complex as building compound statements and expressions also bares some complexity. Before a compound statement or expression can be built all its child nodes and their associated types (if any) needs to be mapped. Figure \ref{visitIfStatement} shows an if-statement AST node is built.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\centerline{\includegraphics[width=16cm]{resources/images/VisitIfStatement.png}}
		\end{center}
		\caption{To build an if-statement node its child nodes; condition, if-block and else-block (if any) has to be built first. Note that \texttt{SS} is the Script\# namespace}
		\label{visitIfStatement}
	\end{figure}

	When a builder class is done building the node(s) are returned to the parent builder class. Once all the namespaces has been built these constitute the Script\# AST which is then passed on in the overall workflow (to script generation).
% section building_the_scriptsharp_ast (end)

\section{Script Generation} % (fold)
\label{sec:script_generation}
	Script generation is done using the Script\# infrastructure only. Specifically the \texttt{TypeGenerator} class located in the \texttt{ScriptSharp.Generator} namespace is used for this. The \texttt{MiCSManager} is responsible for instantiating the \texttt{TypeGenerator} and providing it with types from the Script\# AST. This happens in the \texttt{MiCSManager.GenerateScriptText} method.
% section script_generation (end)

\section{Integration with Web Forms} % (fold)
\label{sec:integration_with_web_forms}
	Because of the time constraint on this project integration with Web Forms has only received a minimum amount of our time. We have ensured that we could implement our case study however there should be made improvements to the Web Forms integration code which we will discuss in section \ref{ssub:integration_with_web_forms}.

	However integration with Web Forms is currently done using the \texttt{MiCSPage} class. The \texttt{MiCSPage} class inherits from the \texttt{System.Web.UI.Page} class so that it’s possible to inherit from the \texttt{MiCSPage} class in one's Code Behind file.  The \texttt{MiCSPage} class searches the specific project's file structure for C\# files, reads their content and passes this content to the \texttt{MiCSManager} who then starts the entire MiCS workflow so that the client side script will be generated. The generated script is then registered with a \texttt{ScriptManager} which is how scripts are embedded into a page from Code Behind.

	\subsection{JavaScript-HTML Consistency} % (fold)
	\label{sub:javascript_html_consistency}
	
	% subsection javascript_html_consistency (end)
	Another important aspect of integration with Web Forms is how the generated client side scripts are initially called. Client side scripts are usually initiated through DOM events such as \texttt{onload} and \texttt{onclick} which are triggered when a web page is loaded and when a button is clicked respectively. MiCS currently only supports registering a client side method on a buttons click event using our \texttt{Button} extension method \texttt{OnClientClick(…)}. However this is how JavaScript-HTML consistency is guaranteed which is possible because the \texttt{Button} Web Control exists in the same C\# compile time validated environment (Code Behind) as the mixed side code and client side code does.
