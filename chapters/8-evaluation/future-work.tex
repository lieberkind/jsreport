\label{sec:futurework}
This section describes which direction the project should take from here; what needs improvements and which features should be implemented next.

\subsection{Testing} % (fold)
\label{sub:fw_testing}
	As stated in the introduction, this project has served as a proof of concept. Even though some testing has been done to secure the correctness of MiCS, it is not enough to guarantee that MiCS works correctly in all situations. MiCS ultimately should serve as a framework for other projects to build on thus test quality and coverage should be prioritized as correctness would be critical.

\subsection{TODO: Portability of Server Side Values} % (fold)
\label{sub:portability_of_server_side_values}
	TODO: Even though server side code can be ported to JavaScript, in some situations the ability to port server side literals could be very handy. 
% subsection portability_of_server_side_values (end)

\subsection{Inheritance} % (fold)
\label{sub:fw_inheritance}
	% Todo: Add to bug list
	Inheritance is a widely used feature of the C\# programming language and the .NET platform in general. Therefore, it should be prioritized to add support for the portability of inherited types. Currently inheritance is not handled at all in which is somewhat limiting. Apart from the developer not being able to create new types that use inheritance, inherited members on DOM types and core types cannot be used without first casting to the parent type. This should obviously be implemented at some point.

\subsection{Event Based Programming} % (fold)
\label{sub:fw_event_based_programming}
	A nice way to keep code decoupled is by using event based programming. Both C\# and JavaScript supports custom events, so support for this feature only seems natural.

\subsection{Caching Generated Scripts} % (fold)
\label{sub:fw_script_caching}
	As of the moment, MiCS generates JavaScript on every page load. To optimize the loading time of every page request, it would be beneficial to investigate the opportunity of caching JavaScript source code that has already been generated.
