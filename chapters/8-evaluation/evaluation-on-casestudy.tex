	We have had success in meeting the requirements set by our case study. All the necessary C\# constructs and types have been implemented and mapped to Script\# correctly, and the case study runs as expected; if the form does not validate on client side, an error message is displayed to the end user. If the validation passes on client side, the form is validated on server side using the same code as the JavaScript was generated from. If the client side validation is bypassed, e.g. by disabling JavaScript in the browser, the form is validated on server side. The full code needed to implement our case study is enclosed in appendix X TODO: REF.

	% 	\item It's doable. Horray!
